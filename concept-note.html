      <h1>Concept Note — Inference sovereignty and sovereign inference</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        This independent Concept Note proposes a working definition of inference sovereignty,
        sketches a sovereignty stack covering data, compute, models, inference, telemetry and operations,
        and outlines illustrative governance questions for AI inference workloads in cloud and edge environments.

        This document is informational only. It does not represent an official position from any public authority,
        regulator, standard setter, cloud provider or company.
      </p>

      <h2>0. Purpose and scope of this Concept Note</h2>
      <p>
        InferenceSovereignty.com is a privately held, descriptive .com domain name.
        It is reserved as a potential neutral banner for public facing content on inference sovereignty and sovereign inference.
        This Concept Note has three objectives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a clear, non promotional definition of inference sovereignty.</li>
        <li>
          Situate inference sovereignty within a broader sovereignty stack that also includes data, compute,
          model, telemetry and operational sovereignty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Outline practical governance questions that boards, regulators and technical teams can use when
          they analyse where and how AI inferences are executed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Note does not create rights or obligations. It does not prescribe a particular architecture
        or technological solution. It is intended as a conceptual reference that may help legitimate institutions
        frame their own policies and standards.
      </p>

      <h2>1. From data sovereignty to inference sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        Over roughly the last decade, data sovereignty has become a central theme in digital policy and cloud strategy,
        especially in jurisdictions that are sensitive to extraterritorial access, localisation requirements and
        critical infrastructure resilience. Organisations and regulators have focused on where data are stored,
        processed and transferred across borders, and under which legal regimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, compute sovereignty debates have emerged around control over chips, accelerators, fabs and cloud
        capacity. Model sovereignty discussions have followed as frontier models and domain specific AI systems
        have become strategic assets in their own right.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, AI workloads are increasingly deployed as distributed inference services:
        at the edge, in sovereign or regional cloud regions, within telecoms networks or in industrial facilities.
        For many high impact use cases, the main question is no longer only where data sit or where models are trained,
        but where and under which law model outputs are generated, logged, audited and used in day to day decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naming this set of questions inference sovereignty provides a way to focus attention on the execution layer
        of AI systems, without assuming a specific institutional answer.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Working definition and sovereignty stack</h2>
      <p>
        Inference sovereignty can be described, in a descriptive and non normative way, as the combination of
        legal, technical and governance questions that arise when organisations and regulators ask:
        who controls AI inference workloads, where exactly are they run, which law applies at runtime,
        and what guarantees exist about logging, telemetry and audit.
      </p>

      <div class="taxonomy-grid">
        <div class="taxonomy-item">
          <h3>Data sovereignty</h3>
          <p>
            Focused on data residency, permitted processing locations and cross border flows for personal, industrial
            and sensitive data, including access by foreign authorities and data localisation measures.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="taxonomy-item">
          <h3>Compute sovereignty</h3>
          <p>
            Focused on control over compute infrastructure and supply chains: chips, accelerators, fabs, clouds and
            sovereign or regional compute capacity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="taxonomy-item">
          <h3>Model sovereignty</h3>
          <p>
            Focused on who owns, governs and can alter AI models, including licensing, fine tuning, deployment controls,
            export considerations and long term maintainability.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="taxonomy-item">
          <h3>Inference sovereignty</h3>
          <p>
            Focused on where models are actually executed at runtime, who controls inputs and outputs during inference,
            how logs and telemetry are handled, and which assurance mechanisms exist to demonstrate that inference occurs
            where and how it is supposed to.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="taxonomy-item">
          <h3>Telemetry sovereignty</h3>
          <p>
            Focused on who can access operational telemetry, monitoring data, incident traces and performance indicators
            related to AI systems in production.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="taxonomy-item">
          <h3>Operational sovereignty</h3>
          <p>
            Focused on who holds decision rights over deployment, configuration, incident response and business continuity
            for AI enabled systems and services, including in times of crisis.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        These layers are interdependent but not interchangeable.
        Inference sovereignty is the point where decisions are actually produced in daily operations, which means that
        it is often the place where sector specific regulation, safety requirements and accountability converge.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Threats, constraints and drivers at the inference layer</h2>
      <p>
        When organisations examine inference sovereignty, several recurring themes appear across sectors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Jurisdiction and applicable law.</strong> Inference workloads may be executed in regions with different
          legal regimes from the data subjects or from the regulator of the deploying organisation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data exfiltration and side channels.</strong> Even if primary data flows are controlled,
          inference workloads can emit logs, telemetry or intermediate representations that reveal sensitive information
          or allow reconstruction of inputs and outputs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Supply chain and dependency risk.</strong> Inference may depend on proprietary accelerators,
          cloud services or software stacks whose governance lies outside the jurisdiction of the deploying entity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Logging and auditability.</strong> Insufficient or fragmented logging practices make it difficult
          to reconstruct which model executed which inference, with which configuration, on which inputs, at which time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Operational control.</strong> Outsourced or highly automated deployment pipelines can blur the line
          between who is effectively operating the system and who remains accountable to regulators and the public.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Controls and mechanisms relevant to inference sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        Organisations and regulators have a growing menu of controls and mechanisms that can support inference sovereignty
        goals. The list below is descriptive and non exhaustive.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Location and residency controls.</strong> Contractual, technical and organisational measures to
          constrain inference workloads to specific regions, availability zones or on premises infrastructures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confidential computing and trusted execution environments.</strong> Hardware rooted mechanisms that
          protect data and models in use, combined with remote attestation to provide evidence about where and how
          inference workloads run.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Input and output governance.</strong> Policies and technical guardrails that specify which inputs
          may be sent to which models, how prompts or sensor data are pre processed, and how outputs are filtered,
          rate limited and logged.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Logging, telemetry and retention policies.</strong> Structured, tamper evident logging of inference
          events, retention rules aligned with legal requirements, and separation of duties for access to sensitive logs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Model and configuration registries.</strong> Registries that tie together model versions, deployment
          configurations, cryptographic attestations and operational runbooks to support audit and incident response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Independent testing and assurance.</strong> External or second line assessments that examine whether
          inference workloads behave as intended in specific jurisdictions and sectors, without turning the assessor into
          the de facto operator of the system.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="box">
        <strong>Important clarification.</strong>
        The presence of such mechanisms does not in itself guarantee compliance with any law, regulation or standard.
        InferenceSovereignty.com does not certify, endorse or validate technologies, providers or architectures.
      </div>

      <h2>5. Relation with existing AI governance frameworks</h2>
      <p>
        Inference sovereignty questions do not appear in a vacuum. They interact with broader AI governance frameworks
        and emerging standards that ask organisations to manage AI risks across the full lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Risk management frameworks for AI, as well as emerging AI management system standards, encourage organisations
        to integrate governance of design, training, deployment, monitoring and incident management into a coherent whole.
        Requirements in upcoming AI regulations, in particular on logging, record keeping and transparency for high risk
        systems, add a legal dimension to many of the operational themes described here.
      </p>
      <p>
        InferenceSovereignty.com does not attempt to restate or interpret any specific framework or regulation.
        References to them are purely contextual. Any organisation seeking to apply those instruments should rely on
        official texts and qualified professional advice.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Illustrative sectors and scenarios</h2>
      <p>
        The following examples illustrate where inference sovereignty questions are likely to be salient in practice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Financial services.</strong> Credit scoring, trading, market surveillance and fraud detection systems
          where the location and logging of inferences relate directly to prudential and conduct obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Healthcare and life sciences.</strong> AI systems that support diagnosis, triage or treatment decisions,
          with inference workloads that need to respect health data regimes and patient rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Public sector, defence and security.</strong> Intelligence analysis, situational awareness and mission
          support tools where inference locations and control structures raise questions of security, accountability and oversight.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Industrial, energy and transport systems.</strong> Edge AI controlling or advising on grid operations,
          rail signalling, aviation, maritime or autonomous vehicles, where safety and liability depend on verifiable behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Telecoms and critical networks.</strong> AI driven network optimisation, anomaly detection and slicing,
          often operating under telecom regulation and national security constraints.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These scenarios are indicative only. Any concrete deployment must be analysed in its own technical, legal,
        organisational and societal context.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Terminology and neighbouring concepts</h2>
      <p>
        A number of terms are used in practice to capture overlapping aspects of the same space:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Inference sovereignty.</strong> Neutral, descriptive label for control over locations, legal regimes
          and governance mechanisms around inference workloads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sovereign inference.</strong> Often used by providers and users to describe inference workloads that
          run in clearly defined sovereign or regional environments with specific separation from global infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In country inference.</strong> Emphasis on ensuring that inference workloads remain inside a particular
          jurisdiction or regulatory area, sometimes as part of data localisation or sector specific requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inference governance.</strong> Broader label for policies, processes, metrics and oversight that
          apply specifically to inference behaviour and performance of AI systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confidential inference.</strong> Technical focus on using confidential computing, secure enclaves
          and attestation to protect data and models during inference.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        InferenceSovereignty.com does not attempt to impose a single definition or brand among these terms.
        Its role is to provide a clear conceptual map that others can adapt to their mandates.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Possible roles for InferenceSovereignty.com (illustrative only)</h2>
      <p>
        Subject to future decisions by legitimate stewards, InferenceSovereignty.com could serve several public interest roles,
        always as a neutral banner rather than as a branded commercial service. Examples include:
